      Special thanks to Sibylle Kuder: for making sure I formed good habits; for teaching perfect practice; and for her hours spent
      finding pieces for me - I still love to play Clementi in C.

      Sibylle, <br />
      Thank you for teaching so effectively  and thoughtfully. You are brilliant! We are enjoying the fruits of your efforts as we
      listen to T. and S. play the piano.

			I am writing this email to express my gratitude to UFM for offering an excellent piano course (Piano II) to music loving, but 
			otherwise unconfident in learning piano playing, adults like me.  Ms. Sibylle Kuder did an excellent job teaching this course. [...] 
			I am an engineer without a good education and training in music. At the age of 55, I feel lucky to have a good teacher like Ms. Kuder 
			teaching me piano. I feel I have found a place outside my heavy-duty teaching and research work to enjoy my life. [...] I would like 
			to suggest that UFM offer a piano III class. I will be the first to enroll in that class if Ms. Kuder is the teacher.<br />
			Sincerely,<br />
			"Tom"

			Dear Sibylle,<br />
			You ran a wonderful competition on Saturday—so organized! And congratulations on training so many student winners! You should feel 
			very proud that you’re building a studio with a strong reputation for performance excellence.<br />
			Warm regards,<br />

			 You are very good with the children and I know that Zoe and Mia both enjoy working with you.  You make it interesting for them and they 
			like it.  Your teaching style is perfectly suited to Zoe&#39;s learning style.  Mia is a bit more flexible in that area, but Zoe needs 
			exactly what you are giving her. <br />
			I am thrilled with the lessons you are providing them.  I think they will grow to love music as well as lessons a great deal while they 
			are in your hands.<br />
			Thanks,<br />
			Melissa<br />
			ps. After you leave our house, the kids always want to play the piano for another half hour or so, even if it is just "playing".  To me 
			that is as important as the lesson because it shows that they have a genuine interest.

			Hey Ms. Kuder,<br />
			I just wanted to let you know that during music classes on Thursday, Dr. Littrell was impressed by how much I knew about music theory, and 
			asked me where I&#39;d learned it. It was you, of course. Thanks for that, I never really realized how much I'd learned from you!
